# Lewis Primes
Lewis primes are of form 10^n - 11 is prime. For example, 10^2 - 11 = 89 is prime. 

## History
I came up with Lewis Primes at work, and I remembered a prime sieve I made had yielded 99,999,989, which is a prime of 10^8 - 11. I named it after myself, as I seem to be the first to discover it.

## Properties
- Lewis primes are of form 10^n - 11
- n must be greater than 1
- n must be a positive integer
- Not all numbers of form 10^n - 11 are prime
- The number of digits in a Lewis prime is equal to n
