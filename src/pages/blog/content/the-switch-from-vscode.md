When I loaded NixOS onto my brand-new Framework 13, the first thing I did was install the different apps I needed.
One of those apps was my favorite IDE: VSCode.
However, before I configured it, I wondered if I could try to switch to a more powerful IDE, since I already use Android Studio for the FTC team I am on.
Using my GitHub Student Developer Pack, I installed JetBrains's IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.

While switching operating systems is easy, switching IDEs is not.
Everything was new to me, and I can't just hit `Ctrl + J` to open the built-in terminal.
Most plugins require a restart of the IDE, unlike in VSCode, where it hot loads it into effect.

However, despite the cultural change, I am getting more used to IntelliJ IDEA, and I no longer have that unconfigured install of VSCode on my system.
Even though there is a learning curve, many of the features in IntelliJ IDEA are familiar (other than file deletion through the GUI, I still need to get used to that.)
As an added bonus, I use one less project by the creators of the horrendous operating system called "Windows".
